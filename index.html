                <h2>Why build a school in Kenya?</h2>
                <p>The inspiration for this project came from Sister Hitha, a cherished mentor and former school director with whom we have a long history – including our collaborative efforts in establishing a school in Kerala, India. Now in Kenya, Sister Hitha leads a dedicated team of Indian and Kenyan nuns committed to providing educational opportunities for children who, due to financial hardships, cannot attend public schools. Our initiative not only seeks to lift these children out of poverty through education but also aims to create local opportunities that help reduce illegal immigration.</p>

                <h2>A Detailed look at the Project</h2>
                <p>Gruppo Nairobi is building a world-class primary school in the heart of Kenya, providing children with quality education that fosters creativity and growth. With six classrooms planned on donated land, this vision needs €180,000 to become a reality. Your support will help create a space where young minds can thrive.</p>
